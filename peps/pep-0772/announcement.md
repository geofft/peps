You can help to create the new Python Packaging Council!
===

The Python project is forming a Packaging Council, an elected group of reviewers for packaging standards. If you are involved with Python packaging in any capacity, you are encouraged to **register to vote for the first Packaging Council election** later this year. Now is also a great time to **think about who you know who might make a good member of the council** - perhaps you yourself!

What is the Packaging Council?
---

The Python project adopts standards through the [Python Enhancement Proposals](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/) (PEP) process. PEPs are reviewed by either the Python Steering Council, an elected group of five experienced Python contributors, or a person or group they delegate.

The Python Packaging Council will be a group of five people with specific experience in Python packaging who will be delegated review authority over all packaging PEPs. In addition to this formal authority, the Packaging Council will also be charged with working to improve Python packaging in general, including by encouraging contributions and fostering conversations between the wide array of people affected by Python packaging.

The Packaging Council itself is being formed through the PEP process in 
[PEP 772](https://peps.python.org/pep-0772/), which defines its work this way:

> **Mandate.** The council shall work to:
> 
> * Maintain the quality and stability of the Python packaging standards.
> * Formalise and maintain the relationship with the core team as well as the
>   PSF.
> * Establish appropriate decision-making processes.
> * Improve Python packaging's user experience.
> * Make contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible.
> * Strive to seek consensus among contributors before acting in a formal
>   capacity.
> 
> **Responsibilities.** The council shall:
> 
> * Have broad authority over the Python packaging standards and Python Packaging
>   User Guide, that are maintained on https://packaging.python.org.
> * Establish processes for making binding decisions regarding packaging
>   standards, tools and implementations as well as for considering
>   ecosystem-wide changes.
> * Look for ways to use their direct authority as little as possible - seeking
>   consensus and consent over voting.

Who votes for the Packaging Council?

You do!

Anyone who is a [voting member of the Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/membership/) is eligible to also vote on who is on the Packaging Council. PSF voting membership is open to the public. You can become a Supporting Member of the PSF and financially support the work of the Foundation, or you can self-certify as a Contributing Member under these rules:

> You qualify as a Contributing Member if you dedicate at least five hours per month volunteering on projects which advance the mission of the PSF by creating or maintaining open source software available to the public at no charge, organizing Python events, participating in one of the PSF's working groups, etc.

"Volunteering on projects" includes reporting bugs, participating in discussion forums, answering questions on StackOverflow, etc. The "[mission of the PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/)" is broad:

> The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

So your volunteering can be on **any projects that promote and advance the Python programming language and facilitate the growth of the Python community**. If you spend at least five hours a month volunteering, you can become a PSF member for free!

In particular, part of the motivation of creating the Packaging Council is to ensure wide representation of all the various communities who work with Python packaging in any form. If you are involved in the PyPA/PyPI/pip/etc. ecosystem, you are encouraged to vote for the Council. If you are involved in the Conda ecosystem, you are encouraged to vote for the Council. If you work on Python packaging for a Linux distro, you are encouraged to vote for the Council. If you work on Python packaging in-house at a large corporation in a way that interacts with the broader Python community, you are encouraged to vote for the Council.

If you register to vote for Council membership, you will receive a couple of emails per year about elections to the Council, and you will be expected to read the nomination statements of the candidates and vote for candidates that you think will best promote Python packaging. That's it!

Who can be on the Packaging Council?
---

Anyone who is eligible to vote can also nominate candidates for the Council, either themselves or other people. Terms on the Council are two years long, staggered so that each year two or three seats will be open for election (except the first year, when all five seats will be open, and the candidates in fourth and fifth place will get one-year terms). Current council members can run for re-election.

No more than two members of the Packaging Council can work for the same company, to avoid conflicts of interest and to ensure that the Council represents a broad set of views in the Python ecosystem.

The work of the Council, at a minimum, is to review and accept or reject PEPs that are ready for review. In practice, as outlined in the appendix of PEP 772, it will likely meet twice a month, get involved in early discussions on PEPs, and maintain active communication with the Python packaging community, the Steering Council, the PSF, and the general Python-using public.

Ideally, the Council will consist of people with at least some domain knowledge of Python packaging, with the capacity to meet regularly, stay involved, and keep learning, who are comfortable with communication and community engagement, and across the five members of the Council, the diversity of Python packaging and the needs of the various communities impacted by this work will be well-represented.

What about the PyPA?
---

The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) formed out of the initial maintainers of `pip`, `virtualenv`, and related tools. It consists of a set of software projects, and its members are those with commit (push) access to these projects. Despite the name, the PyPA for the most part does not have "authority" over anything other than the specific software projects that have joined the PyPA. At the moment, the Steering Council has delegated authority to review PEPs on two specific packaging topics (distribution metadata and index interface) to two individual PyPA members, but they have no other authority in the Python project as a whole. (This delegation will move to the Packaging Council when formed, both to make the review process more representative and to relieve the burden on these two people!)

In practice, there are several other important constituencies in Python packaging, including Conda and Linux distros, who are not represented in PyPA because their projects are not part of PyPA. The PyPA also does not directly represent people who are involved with packaging in ways other than by maintaining projects. So, while the PyPA has done excellent work in the projects it manages and will continue to exist, its goals are different from that of the Packaging Council.

One of the current PyPA member projects is the https://packaging.python.org website, including a set of [PyPA specifications](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/), many of which are living versions of standards originally adopted through the PEP process. PEP 772 transfers authority over this website and these specs to the Packaging Council (and therefore the approval process for PEP 772 involves both the Python Steering Committee and the PyPA).

How do I get involved?
---

There are two things you can do now to get involved in the work of the Council:
* Sign up as a PSF member so you can vote and nominate candidates.
* Thoughtfully consider who would make good members of the Packaging Council.

More details about the Packaging Council, its authority, and the election process are in [PEP 772](https://peps.python.org/pep-0772/). Feedback is welcome on the "Discussions-To" link at the top of the document. The document is currently a draft, but the hope is to get it finalized and approved within the next few weeks and run the first elections later this year.

In particular, the intention of the proposal is to ensure that everyone with an interest in Python packaging will be able to vote and get involved. If you have suggestions for how to improve the process, please get involved in the discussions!
